        <p>Sri Lankan traditional food is known for its particular combinations of herbs, spices, fish, vegetables, rice,
            and fruits. The cuisine is highly centered around many varieties of rice, as well as coconut, which is a ubiquitous plant throughout the country. Seafood also plays a significant role in the cuisine, whether fresh fish or preserved. As a country that was a hub in the historic oceanic silk road, contact with foreign traders brought new food items and cultural influences, in addition to the local traditions of the country's ethnic groups, all of which have helped shape Sri Lankan cuisine.</p>
