    <article><blockquote><p>Pol Roti is a traditional Sri Lankan flatbread made primarily with coconut and flour. 
        It's a popular and versatile dish enjoyed across the island, often served for breakfast or dinner.
        This roti is cherished for its simplicity, ease of preparation, and the comforting combination of 
        flavors, making it a staple in Sri Lankan cuisine. Here's a bit more detail:</p></blockquote></article><br>

    <blockquote><dl><dt><h2>Ingredients:</h2></dt></blockquote>
   <dd> <blockquote><p>Flour: Typically, all-purpose flour or wheat flour is used.
    <br><br>Fresh Grated Coconut: The key ingredient, which gives the roti its distinctive taste and texture.
    <br><br>Water: To bind the ingredients together.
    <br><br>Salt: For seasoning.

    <blockquote><dl><dt><h2>Preparation:</h2></dt></blockquote>
    <dd><blockquote><p><b>Step 1:</b><br> Mixing the Dough: The flour, grated coconut, salt, and any optional 
        ingredients (like chopped onions, green chilies, and curry leaves) are mixed together. Water is 
        gradually added to form a soft dough.
        <br><br><b>Step 2:</b><br>Shaping: The dough is divided into small balls, which are then flattened into round discs.
        <br><br><b>Step 3:</b><br>Cooking: The discs are cooked on a heated griddle or tawa until both sides 
        are golden brown. The roti can be served hot or at room temperature.

        <blockquote><dl><dt><h2>Serving:</h2></dt></blockquote>
            <dd><blockquote><p>Pol Roti is often served with a side of curry, sambol (such as lunu miris, a 
                spicy onion relish), or dhal (lentil curry). It pairs well with both savory and sweet 
                accompaniments, making it a versatile dish for any meal of the day.
